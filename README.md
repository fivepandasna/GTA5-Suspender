## Purpose
- Suspending the GTA5_Enahnced.exe process for 10 seconds does many thing that are helpful
- If you're stuck on a loading screen, it will often get you out of it
- When suspend the process in an online session with other players, it will dissonnect them from your session
- You and the other players will both keep identical sessions with the same active missions, vehicles, and all progress
- This works because of the peer to peer servers that GTA 5 uses
- This can be done at any time, including during missions like if you're being attacked during a sell mission.
