How to install the script 

1. Download GTASuspend.ahk from the latest [release](https://github.com/fivepandasna/GTA5-Suspender/releases)

2. You're done! Open the file and click shift + delete to run the script

## Usage
- Click Shift + Del on your keyboard to suspend GTA5_Enhanced.exe for 8 seconds
- Click Shift + Del again to resume the process before the countdown is up
- The countdown will show in the middle of your screen if you aren't in fullscreen

## Purpose
- Suspending the GTA5_Enahnced.exe process for 8 seconds does many thing that are helpful
- If you're stuck on a loading screen, it will often get you out of it
- When suspend the process in an online session with other players, it will dissonnect them from your session
- You and the other players will both keep identical sessions with the same active missions, vehicles, and all progress
- This works because of the peer to peer servers that GTA 5 uses
- This can be done at any time, including during missions like if you're being attacked during a sell mission.
